# Polynomial exclusive lasso-based K-nearest-neighbor algorithm in data analysis

## Introduction: 
My research focused on generalizing the Exclusive Lasso-based K-nearest-neighbors that is used to predict categories of high-dimensional dataset. 

## Research goal: 
- Predict the class of a data point y by finding the data points closest to it and considering their classes.
- The algorithm finds a sparse vector representing the observations that are relevant in predicting the class of new observations.
- For an input vector y, the class of y is predicted by considering the k largest coefficients of this sparse vector.

## Overall research methods:
- Please refer to the research poster for research summary and results.
